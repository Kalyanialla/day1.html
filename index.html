<h1>Frontend technologies</h1>
<h2>HTML</h2>
<p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.<br> It is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It tells the web browser how to display text, links, images, and other forms of multimedia on a webpage. HTML sets up the basic structure of a website, and then CSS and JavaScript add style and interactivity to make it look and function better.

How Does HTML Work? - HTML documents are plain-text files saved with an .html extension. Browsers read these documents, interpret the markup (tags and attributes), and render the formatted content on your screen.</p>
<h2>CSS</h2>
<p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets<br>. It is a stylesheet language used to style and enhance website presentation.

CSS is one of the main three components of a webpage along with HTML and JavaScript.
HTML adds Structure to a Webpage, JavaScript adds logic to it and CSS makes it visually visually appealing or stylish. It controls the layout of a web page i.e. how HTML elements will be displayed on a webpage.
CSS was released (in 1996), 3 years after HTML (in 1993). The main idea behind its use is, it allows the separation of content (HTML) from presentation (CSS). This makes websites easier to maintain and more flexible.</p>
<h2>JAVA SCRIPT</h2>
<p>JavaScript is a programming language used to create dynamic content for websites. It is a lightweight, cross-platform, and single-threaded programming language. JavaScript is an interpreted language that executes code line by line providing more flexibility.

HTML adds Structure to a web page, CSS styles it and JavaScript brings it to life by allowing users to interact with elements on the page, such as actions on clicking buttons, filling out forms, and showing animations.
JavaScript on the client side is directly executed in the user's browser. Almost all browsers have JavaScript Interpreter and do not need to install any software. There is also a browser console where you can test your JavaScript code.
JavaScript is also used on the Server side (on Web Servers) to do operations like accessing databases, file handling and security features to send responses, to browsers.</p>
<h1>Backend technologies</h1>
<h2>PYTHON</h2>
<p>Python is a widely used high-level, interpreted programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and further developed by the Python Software Foundation. It was designed with an emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of code. Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently.

Python is widely used language
Python is used for:

Web Development: Frameworks like Django, Flask.
Data Science and Analysis: Libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.
Machine Learning and AI: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn.
Automation and Scripting: Automate repetitive tasks.
Game Development: Libraries like Pygame.
Web Scraping: Tools like BeautifulSoup, Scrapy.
Desktop Applications: GUI frameworks like Tkinter, PyQt.
Scientific Computing: SciPy, SymPy.
Internet of Things (IoT): MicroPython, Raspberry Pi.
DevOps and Cloud: Automation scripts and APIs.
Cybersecurity: Penetration testing and ethical hacking tools.</p>
<h2>JAVA</h2>
<p>Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers Write Once and Run Anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems Inc. in May 1995 and later acquired by Oracle Corporation and is widely used for developing applications for desktop, web, and mobile devices.

Java is known for its simplicity, robustness, and security features, making it a popular choice for enterprise-level applications. Java applications are compiled to byte code that can run on any Java Virtual Machine. The syntax of Java is similar to C/C++.

Java makes writing, compiling, and debugging programming easy. It helps to create reusable code and modular programs.</P>
<h2>NODEJS</h2>
<p>Node.js is a powerful, open-source, and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 engine.

It allows you to run JavaScript code outside the browser, making it ideal for building scalable server-side and networking applications.
JavaScript was earlier mainly used for frontend development. With Node JS (Introduced in 2009), JavaScript became a backend language as well.
Non-blocking, event-driven architecture for high performance.
Supports the creation of REST APIs, real-time applications, and microservices.
Comes with a rich library of modules through npm (Node Package Manager)</P>
